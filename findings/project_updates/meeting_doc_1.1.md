# Demand/Stock Forecasting

## Model difference per-customer
Models provide different performance depending on the customer. Some customers have better predictions with Random Forest, some with XGBoost and others with Neural Networks.

Mostly, models provide similar evaluative scores for the customers. Since the SCM is a volitile enviroment, its hard to directly determine required order quantities due to uncertainty of multiple factors, such as seasonal demand, geopolitical issues and trends in purchasing.
