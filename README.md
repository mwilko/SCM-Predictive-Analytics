## Introduction
High interests in machine learning (ML) and data visualisation resulted in this research and application of predictive analysis in the supply chain management (SCM).

Catapult Print, a start-up company growing to 60 million dollars turnover in five years, has kindly pre-processed and offered operational datasets for this project for me to perform data science techniques which could be an useful deliverable for them.

The final aim of this project is to gain crucial data science knowledge while also working with raw real-world company datasets to perform real-time analytical insight.

## Demand Forecasting
SCM is a volitile and highly fluctuating industry, Catapult needs to have an accurate forecasting to ensure they keep the competitive edge that they are trying to uphold.

Utilising historical data from product orders provided by Catapult with their datasets, ML can be incorporated to predict the future order quantities.
