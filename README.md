# Predictive analytics for Supply Chain Managment

High interests in machine learning and data visualisation resulted in this research and application of predictive analysis in the supply chain management.

Catapult Print, a start-up company growing to 60 million dollars turnover in five years, has kindly pre-processed and offered operational datasets for this project for me to perform data science techniques which could be an useful deliverable for them.

The final aim of this project is to gain crucial data science knowledge while also working with raw real-world company datasets to perform real-time analytical insight.
